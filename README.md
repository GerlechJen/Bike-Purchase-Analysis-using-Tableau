# Tableau-Project




The data initially had 1024 rows. I started by deleting duplicates. 24 duplicate rows were detected and deleted leaving the rows to be worked on at 1000. 

DATA CLEANING 
The Marital Status column was labeled single or married while the Gender column was labeled Male and Female instead of M and S and M and F respectively. The decimal places was removed from the Income column and the column assigned curreny. I then created a new column called Age Bracket and categorized the ages as follows. People older than 54 years were categorised as "Old", those older than 31 years but younger than 55 years were called "Middle Age" and those younger than 31 years, 'Adolescents".
